# `clowder-test`

Command line test runner

To install the test runner, run the [test script](../script/test). This will install the `clowder-test` runner. If `CLOWDER_PROJECT_PATH` is set to point to the directory the clowder project was cloned, the command can be run from any directory. Otherwise must be run from the root directory of the repository.

For more information, see the `clowder-test` help:

```bash
clowder-test -h
```
